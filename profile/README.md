We're passionate about making the internet a more private place, one URL at a time. Our flagship project, Linkumori (URLs Purifier), is a powerful browser extension that helps users maintain their privacy while browsing by automatically removing tracking parameters from URLs and blocking hyperlink auditing.

## 🌟 Our Mission

To provide open-source tools that enhance online privacy without compromising user experience. We believe that privacy should be accessible to everyone, and our solutions are designed to work seamlessly in the background while providing powerful protection.
